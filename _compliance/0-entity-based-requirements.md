### <a id="Risk Assessment"></a> Risk Assessment

Regulated Dealers are required to perform an assessment of the money laundering (**"ML"**) and terrorism financing (**"TF"**) risks faced by their business. They are also required to develop internal policies, procedures and controls (**"IPPC"**) to manage and effectively mitigate ML/TF risks.

Please refer to the video to understand more about the entity-based requirements for a regulated dealer. The requirements are also set out under Annex A of the [Guidelines for Regulated Dealers](/images/Guidelines%20for%20regulated%20dealers_20190828_V1.1Final.pdf).
