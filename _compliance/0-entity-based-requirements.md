####  Risk Assessment and Internal Policies, Procedures and Controls

Regulated Dealers are required to perform an assessment of the money laundering (**"ML"**) and terrorism financing (**"TF"**) risks faced by their business. They are also required to develop internal policies, procedures and controls (**"IPPC"**) to manage ML/TF risks.

This video can help you understand the entity-based requirements for a regulated dealer. Annex A of the [Guidelines for Regulated Dealers](/images/Guidelines%20for%20regulated%20dealers_20190828_V1.1Final.pdf) sets out the guidance on the entity-based requirements and should be read in conjunction with the PSPM Act and Regulations.
