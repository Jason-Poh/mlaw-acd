#### What is money laundering and terrorism financing?
Money laundering (**"ML"**) is the process of concealing the proceeds of a crime so that they appear to have originated from legitimate sources. Terrorism financing (**"TF"**) is the funding of terrorism or terrorist groups. Sources of terrorism financing may be legitimate or illegitimate.

#### Who are regulated dealers and why are they regulated by Ministry of Law?
Your favourite jeweller whom you buy your proposal diamond ring from, the familiar neighbourhood goldsmith shop, a second-hand goods dealer whom you trade in your gold and jewellery, or an online bullion trader may be regulated dealers.<br>
Regulated dealers dealing with precious stones, precious metals and/or precious products (**"PSPM"**) are required to be registered under the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Act 2019 (**"PSPM Act"**). This include, but are not limited to jewellers, bullion traders, jewellery wholesalers, jewellery retailers and second-hand goods dealers. The regulated dealers will need to fulfil the requirements under the PSPM Act to prevent ML/TF from taking place through the precious stones and precious metals dealers (**"PSMD"**) sector.

#### What does it mean to me as a customer?
You may be required to provide your personal information and identification documents for verification purposes when you purchase the PSPMs from the regulated dealers. Some common PSPM include diamond and gold jewellery, platinum wedding bands and gold or silver bullion bars. A full list of PSPM is available under our [Regulatory Regime](/regulatory-regime/). By providing these information and documents promptly, you play a part in protecting the PSMD sector from being misused for the criminal activities.  

#### What if i do not give my identifying information to the regulated dealer?
The law prohibits regulated dealers from completing the transaction with you, if you do not provide these information. 

#### What happens to my personal information?
All personal information provided by you to the regulated dealers will be kept confidential in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012. You may refer to the Notice for Customers [here](/notice-for-customers/) for more information on the type of information regulated dealers may require from you.
