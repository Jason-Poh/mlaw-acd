### <a id="Customer Due Diligence"></a> Customer Due Diligence

Customer Due Diligence (**"CDD"**) is the process of obtaining your customers' identifying information and verifying who they are before transacting with them. The objective is to help you determine the ML/TF risks and take appropriate mitigating measures to address them.

In the event where you are unable to perform or complete the required CDD, you must not carry out the transaction with the customer, terminate any transaction entered into with the cusotmer, and consider whether to file a STR. If you suspect that the customer is in the listings for terrorist designation and designated individuals and entities, you must stop the transaction and report to the police. Please refer to our Guidelines more for information.

### <a id="Enhanced Customer Due Diligence"></a> Enhanced Customer Due Diligence

Enhanced Customer Due Diligence (**"ECDD"**) is the process of conducting a higher level of CDD, due to the potentially higher ML/TF risk involved. By conducting ECDD, you are mitigating the ML/TF risks faced when conducting the transaction.

In addition, Regulated Dealers may adopt further enhanced measures if you determine that such measures are more proportionate to the ML/TF risks faced. Please refer to our Guidelines more for information.

### <a id="Cash Transaction Report"></a> Cash Transaction Report

Registered dealer who enters into any designated transaction must submit a cash transaction report (CTR) electronically to the Suspicious Transaction Reporting Office (STRO) within 15 business days via [SONAR](www.police.gov.sg/sonar). As part of record keeping, you are required to keep a copy of the filed CTR for 5 years after the date of submission.


### <a id="Suspicious Transaction Report"></a> Suspicious Transaction Report

Registered dealers are required to file a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) when there are suspicions on ML/TF activities in the business transaction. This should be filed electronically via SONAR. Regulated Dealers are reminded that it is an offence to disclose the fact that a STR was file. 
Please refer to the SONAR website on how to file a STR.
