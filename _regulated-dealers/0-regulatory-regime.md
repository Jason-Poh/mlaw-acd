The regime will cover regulated dealers.

A “regulated dealer” is any person who carries on a business:<br>
(a)	of regulated dealing; or <br>
(b)	as an intermediary for regulated dealing.

“Regulated dealing” means: <br>
(a)	selling, offering for sale, purchasing for the purpose of resale, importing for sale, possessing for sale, or manufacturing any “precious stone”, “precious metal” or “precious product”; or <br>
(b)	selling or redeeming any “asset-backed token”. 

**Examples**

Regulated dealers include, but are not limited to, jewellers, bullion traders, jewellery wholesalers, jewellery retailers and second-hand goods dealers. The regime also applies to regulated dealers who are based overseas but carry on a business of regulated dealing in Singapore.

Intermediaries for regulated dealing who are covered under the regime include, but are not limited to, auction houses and trading platforms.

Importantly, the regime does **not** intend to cover individuals who make one-off purchases and subsequently decide to sell their items to a second-hand goods dealer. Further, pawnbrokers are **not** regulated dealers as they are already subject to AML/CFT measures under the Pawnbrokers Act.

“Precious stones” (natural or otherwise) include diamonds, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, jade (including nephrite and jadeite), and pearls.

“Precious metals” include gold, silver, platinum, iridium, osmium, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, and alloys with at least 2% in weight of any of the metals stated above.

“Precious products” include, but are not limited to, any jewellery, watch, apparel, accessory, ornament or other finished product that is: <br>
(a) made up of, contains or has attached to it any precious stone or metal or both; and<br>
(b) derives at least 50% of its value which is attributable to the precious stone or precious metal or both. <br>
(c) determined by the ratio of the market value of the precious stones and precious metals component to the selling price of the product.

An “asset-backed token” is any token, certificate or instrument: <br>
(i) backed by one or more “precious stone”, “precious metal” or “precious product”; and <br>
(ii) that entitles the holder to the “precious stone”, “precious metal” or “precious product” or part of it (e.g. certificates or tokens).

Asset-backed tokens **do not include** securities or derivative contracts within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Act, or commodity contracts within the meaning of the Commodity Trading Act. Securities contracts, derivative contracts and commodity contracts are **not** covered under the new regime.

### <a id="Our Role in AML/CFT"></a> Our Role in AML/CFT 

Singapore is a member of the Financial Action Task force (**"FATF"**), an inter-governmental body that sets international standards aimed to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing, and the harm these illegal activities cause to society. There are currently more than 200 countries and jurisdictions committed to implementing anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (**"AML/CFT"**) measures in accordance to the recommendations set by the FATF.

Designated non-financial businesses and professions (**"DNFBPs"**) in Singapore, such as the precious stones and precious metals dealers (**"PSMDs"**), have a role to play to ensure that Singapore is effective in implementing its AML/CFT policies through the PSMD sector. The regulatory requirements on the PSMD sector are set out in the PSPM Act and PMLTF Regulations. Regulated dealers should also refer to the Guidelines for Regulated Dealers.

Please refer to the compliance requirements [here](/entity-based-requirements/) for more information on how to implement an effective AML/CFT framework for your business.
